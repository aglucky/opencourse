"A theoretical CS course covering advances in algorithmic game theory. This includes study of strategic, computational, learning, dynamic, and fairness aspects of games and markets (organizations that involves rational and strategic agents). In particular, topics will include computation and complexity of equilibria, mechanism design, fair-division, dynamics in games and markets, price-of-anarchy etc.. These topics arise from applications such as online marketplaces (like Lyft, Uber, eBay, sponsored search, TaskRabbit), social networks, recommendation systems, kidney exchange, spectrum auction, etc., and thereby will prepare students for related research and/or industry jobs.

"The purpose of the course is to give each student enough background and training in the area of algorithmic genomic biology so that each will be able to do research in this area, and publish papers. The main focus of the course is phylogeny (evolutionary tree) estimation, multiple sequence alignment, and genome-scale phylogenetics, which are problems that present very interesting challenges from a computational and statistical standpoint. Time permitting, we will also discuss computational problems in microbiome analysis, protein function and structure prediction, genome assembly, and even historical linguistics. Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The course is designed for doctoral students in computer science, computer engineering, bioengineering, mathematics, and statistics, and does not depend on any prior background in biology. The technical material will depend on discrete",[{}],,https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/CS581,Algorithmic Genomic Biology,CS 581,,http://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/CS581-Fa2021-short.html
"Will introduce students to the computational principles involved in autonomous vehicles, with practical labwork on an actual vehicle. Sensing topics will include vision, lidar and sonar sensing, including state-of-the-art methods for detection, classification, and segmentation. Bayesian filtering methods will be covered in the context of both SLAM and visual tracking. Planning and control topics will cover vehicle dynamics models, state-lattice planning, sampling-based kinodynamic planning, optimal control and trajectory optimization, and some reinforcement learning. Evaluation will involve ambitious challenge projects implemented on a physical vehicle. Course Information: 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

"This graduate course on bioinformatics introduces a selection of topics in computational biology and bioinformatics, with special emphasis on current problems in regulatory genomics and systems biology. Computational approaches discussed will focus on Machine Learning techniques such as Bayesian inference, graphical models, supervised learning and network analysis. Bioinformatics topics will be introduced through lectures by instructor and research paper presentations by students, and include regulatory sequence analysis, cistromics, epigenomics, regulatory network reconstruction, non-coding variant interpretation, and protein structure and function prediction. A research project involving real data analysis with techniques related to course content is mandatory and will help prepare students for bioinformatics research.

"Online social interactions occur in many arenas important to society and human well-being, but are mediated through algorithmic interventions that alter the users expectations in these social spaces. This class explores the presentation of self, the presentation of collectives, the presentation of news, and social dynamics in these online spaces--and how algorithmic intervention shapes them from the perspective of social signaling theory. Topics covered include: the evolution of algorithmic matchmaking (as in online resume/interviews and dating sites), why people share misinformation, the mitigation of trolling, ethics, and bias in social media systems. Upon completion of this course, students will have an up-to-date understanding of the design social media interfaces with incentive structures from social signaling theory.
