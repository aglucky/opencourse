# The Gluck OCW Collection

## The Goal
Get courses from as many top colleges as possibles

## The Approach
Currently using college course listing and scraping for course info and websites, along 
with instructor websites. Ignoring pay to win shit like coursera and now edx

## TODOS
There is a lot of potential using professors' personal websites. If a general enough purpose Spider
can be made, a shit ton more courses will be found by scraping faculty directories for websites and
taking course links and info from There.
